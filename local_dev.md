## Problems and their Solutions


### 1) Page number disorder while loading chapter content, input of unwanted book pages.

Add a node in `ChapterContentLoader` subagent that tells the page number of first chapter
    and according to that exact content will be load.



### 2) Huge time while fetching a particular chapter.

Reason: Most use of Glue code
Solution: Use genunine methods to load a particular chapter content. Handle this situation on `PDFProcessor().load_pdf()` in `pdf_processor.py`
It will be descrease about ~20 seconds of latency.
